Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales\u201d is set out in \nparagraph s 01 \u2013 53. All the paragraphs have equal authority.  This standard shoul d be read in the context of its \nobjective  and the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting as endorsed by AAOIFI . \n \nAll AAOIFI FAS s shall be read in conjunction with the definitions, Shari\u2019ah rules and principles and key \nconsiderations provided by AAOIFI  Shari\u2019ah standards in respect of such products and matters.  \n  \n5 \n Preface  \nPR 1  Murabaha and Murabaha to the purchase orderer are the most popular and dominant contracts used \nby Islamic banks and other Islamic Financial Institutions (referred to as \u201cIFI(s)\u201d or  the institution(s) in \nthe Standard) , hence a very important  element in their financial statements.  While Murabaha can be \nexecuted on a spot basis, its most common use by IFI is in the form of deferred payment transactions.  \nPR 2 In addition to Murabaha, th ere are several other transactions of Islamic finance which are based on \ntrade but unlike Murabaha, do not require disclosure of the cost and profit to the intended buyer. \nSuch sales may take different forms and for the purpose of this standard are general ly referred to as \n\u2018deferred payment sales \u2019. \nPR 3  This standard aims at setting out the accounting rules for measurement , recognition  and disclosure of \nthe transactions of Murabaha and other deferred payment sales  that are carried out by Islamic banks \nor IFI.  \nPR 4  This standard supersedes the earlier FAS 2 \u201cMurabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer\u201d and \nFAS 20 \u201cDeferred Payment Sale\u201d.  \n  \n6 \n Introduction  \nOverview  \nIN1 This Standard AAOIFI  Financial Accounting Standard  (FAS)  No. 28 prescribes  the accounting and \nreporting principles  and requirements  for Murabaha and deferred payment sales transactions and \ndifferent elements of such transaction.  \nRationale  for issuing this standard  \nIN2 In lin e with the new financial accounting standards development strategy, the AAOIFI Accounting \nBoard has initiated a review and revision process for certain FAS. As a part of such process, and \nbased on time to time feedback received from the market participants , as well as, the changes and \nupdates in the generally accepted accounting principles set out by other standards setting bodies, it \nwas considered imperative to perform a comprehensive review and revision of the existing \nstandards on Murabaha and deferred payment sales. Additionally, the earlier standard s did not \naddress the issue of accounting for the purchaser in Murabaha and deferred payment sales \ntransactions .   \n  \n7 \n AAOIFI  Financial Accounting S tandard No. 28  \nMurabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales  \nObjective of the Standard  \n1. The objective of this standard is to prescribe the appropriate accounting  and reporting  principles  for \nrecognition, measurement and disclosures to apply in relation to Murabaha  and other  deferred \npayment sales transactions  for the  sellers and buyers , for such transactions .  \nScope  \n2. This standard applies to  accounting for  Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transaction \ncarried out under Shari\u2019ah principles, excluding Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha transactions.  \n3. This standard shall not apply to investment s made in investment instruments e.g. equity instruments \nor Sukuk, where the underlying asset for such instrument is a Murabaha or deferred payment sale.  \nDefinitions  \n4. For the purpose of interpreting and applying this standard, the following short definitions are \nrelevant:  \na. Commodity Murabaha  \u2013 is a Murabaha product based on c ommodity transactions  in the \norganized commodity markets , where both the parties to the transaction have intention only \nto take constructive possession  of th e commodity ; \nb. Control \u2013 an institution controls an asset or business, when it has substantially all risks and \nrewards incidental to ownership of such asset or business, duly meeting both of the following \nconditions:  \ni. it is directly exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns  (negative or positive, \nrespectively)  from its involvement with such assets or business; and  \nii. it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the assets or \nbusiness;  \nc. Deferred payment sale \u2013 is any kind of sales transact ion in which the payment of sales \nconsideration is deferred over a fixed credit term, in installments or on a lump sum basis;  \nd. Fair value \u2013 The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an \norderly transaction between market partic ipants at the measurement date;  \ne. Hamish Jiddiyyah  \u2013 is the amount deposited  as a security against fulfillment of a contract , or \npromise,  or completion of a transaction  by one of the parties to other ; \nf. Inventor y \u2013 in relation to this standard is an asset  held for sale in the ordinary course of \nbusiness  or in the process of production for such sale ; \n8 \n g. Murabaha  \u2013 is sale of goods with an agreed upon profit mark -up on the cost. This could be on \na spot basis or deferred payment basis;  \nh. Murabaha to the purchase orderer  \u2013 refers to a sale and purchase transaction where the \npurchaser makes an order and confirmed his order with a promise ( Wa\u2019ad) to purchase the \nspecified subject matter from the intended seller on agreed Murabaha  terms ; \ni. Musawama  \u2013 is a common bargain sale  where the cost and profit elements are not necessary \nto be disclosed . This could be on a spot basis or deferred payment basis ; \nj. Net realisable value  (NRV)  \u2013 is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business  \nless the estimated co sts of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make  the sale , \nconsidering the factors specific to the institution ; \nk. Promise and mutual promis e \u2013 promise  is a constructive obligation assumed by one party (in \nMurabaha, the purchase o rderer). The promise is  understood to be  binding in religious law on \nthe individual who makes it, unless a legitimate excuse under Islamic Shari\u2019ah  arises and \nprevents its fulfillment. Nevertheless, a promise is understood to be binding from the juristic \nperspective if  it is pending on a cause and the promi ssee has incurred costs by reason of the \npromise. Mutual promis e is a promise against promise ; \nl. Tawarruq \u2013 is a kind of sale transaction where the institution  buys an asset and sells it to the \ncustomer on credit, where by the customer intends  to sell  the purchased asset to another \nparty  immediately for cash ; \nm. Urboun  \u2013 is the amount paid by the intend ing buyer in a sale transaction as a security cum \nadvance payment against the sales price, along with a promise to purchase.  In line with \ncontractual terms, it may be forfeited in case of default in promise to purchase by the buyer.  \nMurabaha  and other deferred payment sale s in the financial statements of the seller  \nInitial recognition  \nInventor ies \n5. Inventor y shall be recognized in the books of the institution  once it controls the inventory i.e. the time \nwhen it essentially acquires  substantially  all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of such \ninventory.  \n6. Inventor ies shall be initially recognized at cost.  The c ost of inventory  shall comprise all costs of \npurchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventory  to its present location and condition.  It \nincludes all types of taxes (other than those subsequently recovered), transportation and handling \ncosts including related Takaful cost  and all other costs directly attributable to bring the asset to its \npresent location and condition  including those incurred by the customer in the capacity of agent  and \nany fee paid to the agent . Trade discounts, rebates and similar items should be deducted from the \ncosts.  \n9 \n 7. In cases where inventories are acquired on a piecemeal basis or in tranches , each tranche  of \ninventories received shall be recognized when the conditions defined in paragraph 5 above are met.  \nReceivable s  \n8. The seller  shall recognize receivables and revenue  in its financial statements,  when the inventory  is \nsold under Murabaha or deferred payment sale contract . [See paragraph s 23 \u2013 28 below for deferred \nprofit treatment].  \n9. Receivable shall be recognized at an amount equal to the face value (gross amount or invoice value) .  \n10. The inventory is considered to be sold under Murabaha or deferred payment sale contract at the time \nof consummation of the Murabaha or deferred payment sal e contract i.e. when such contract \nbecomes legally binding on all parties to the contract  whether the consideration is received or \nreceivable and the control (entailing essentially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership) of the \ninventory is transfer red to the intended buyer .  \nSubsequent measurement  \nInventor ies \n11. Subsequent to the initial recognition, inventor ies shall be measured at the lower of cost and net \nrealizable value . \n12. In situations where a credit -worthy potential customer has a binding promise  to buy the respective \ninventories at a value equal to or higher than the cost, the seller shall carry inventories at cost \nirrespective of fluctuations in fair value of inventories, if any.  \n13. In situations where a binding promise from a credit -worthy potent ial customer as m entioned above is \nnot available,   adjustment in carrying value to write -down to net realizable value (if lower than cost) \nshall be made and corresponding effect of write -down shall be recognized in the period in which such \nimpact is identi fied.  \n14. Any additional handling and holding costs shall be charged  to statement of  income during the period \nin which these arise.  \nReceivables  \n15. Subsequent to initial recognition, gross receivable s shall be carried at their outstanding amount less \nany allowanc e for credit  losses .  \n16. Outstanding amount represent the gross amount of receivables less recoveries or other adjustments \nincluding discounts and rebates allowed, if any . \n17. Allowance for credit  losses1 shall be accounted for in accordance with the relevant FAS.  \n                                                           \n1 Also called provision.  \n10 \n De-recognition  \n18. An asset classified as inventory or receivable shall only be de -recognized in the financial statements if \nit meets the de -recognition criteria of an asset that is \u201cno future economic benefit is expected to flow \nto the institution  from t hat particular asset \u201d. \nInventor ies \n19. Considering the de -recognition criteria provided in paragraph 18 above, inventories shall be \nderecognized upon either:  \na. the institution transferring control to the buyer in form of sale (see paragraph 18); or \nb. the instituti on losing control e.g. in form of physical loss or theft; or  \nc. Inventories losing their capacity of providing future economic benefits e.g. technological \nobsolescence , or legal restrictions  or there if is no expected buyer . \nReceivables  \n20. Considering the de -recognition criteria provided in paragraph 18 above, r eceivables shall be \nderecognized when:  \na. the customer has completely settle d the outstanding amount ; or \nb. the carrying amount cannot be recovered due to customer\u2019s insolvency ; or  \nc. the institution decided to waive its right by writing i t off or treated it as Hibah to the \ncustomer.  \nRevenue and profit recognition  \nRevenue  \n21. See paragraph  8 above  for recognition of revenue and receivables .  \nCost of sales  \n22. Where  inventory is sold under  a Murabaha or deferred payment s ales contract , the carrying amount \nof such inventory , along with any direct expenses incurred, shall be recognized as cost of sales in the \nperiod in which the  related revenue is recognized.  \nProfit deferment  \n23. In case of deferred payment Murabaha  or other def erred payment sales , the profit  arising from the \ntransaction i.e. the difference between revenue and cost of sales recognized , shall be deferred \nthrough a deferred  profit  account . However, i n case where the equivalent cash sale price of the goods \nsold is h igher than the cost of sales, the profit to the extent of difference between the cash sale price \nand the cost of sales shall not be deferred.  \n24. Deferred profit  account  shall be presented as a contra -asset  of respective receivables .  \n11 \n 25. Deferred profit shall be amortized  to income  over the contractual credit period on a time \nproportion ate basis .  \n26. For transactions with installments or lump sum payment at the end, with original maturity of more \nthan 12 months, the appropriate method to appl y the time proportion basis shall be the effective \nprofit rate  method  based on the implicit profit in the transaction.  \n27. For transactions with lump sum payment at the end, with original maturity of 12 months or less, the \nstraight line allocation of profit o ver the contractual credit period  is allowable .  \n28. In case of defaults or possible defaults, the deferred profit shall be treated in accordance with the \nrespective FAS.  \nRelated accounting treatments  \nWaivers, discounts and write -offs \n29. Where a part of the recei vable  has been reduced or waived by the seller  as a rebate on early \nsettlement of the receivable,  or for any other reason,  the amount of reduction / waiver shall be  \nrecognized in the period  in which such settlement occurs , in the following manner:  \na. first, it is to be netted -off against any available balance of deferred profit on such transaction; \nand  \nb. secondly, any remaining balance is to be netted -off against the profit recognized / deferred \nprofit amortized during the current financial period; and  \nc. thirdly , any remaining balance is to be recognized in the statement  of income as an expense \nfor the period .  \nTransaction costs  \n30. Transaction costs incurred, associated with negotiating and arranging a Murabaha  or deferred \npayment sale  contract , net of any reimburse ments by the customer, shall be charged to the statement \nof income in the period in which they are incurred.  \nStructuring and other service fees \n31. Any structuring or similar fee charged to the customer shall be recognized when the related services \nare provided.  \nSubsequent discounts  on inventory  \n32. Any discount received on cost of inventory, subsequent to consummation of sale , shall reduce the cost \nof sales.  \n33. If the discount is passed on to the customer , the same shall be recognized  in the statement of income  \nas a discount (deduction) against the gross revenue.  \n34. If the discount is not passed  on to the customer:  \n12 \n a. in case of cash Murabaha , the same will be recognized  in the statement  income in the period \nin which it arises; and  \nb. in case of deferred payment Murabaha and deferred payment sales, the same shall eventually \nincrease the amount of deferred profit and amortized accordingly.  \nHamish Jiddiyyah and Urboun  \n35. Subject to the terms of the contract , the initial  deposit  or advance payment,  paid by the buyer shall be \nrecognized  as a liability of the seller . \n36. Adjustment of, or forfeiture of, Ha mish Jiddiyyah or Urboun, against breach of promise or default or \nother adverse conditions shall be governed by the Shari\u2019ah  rules and contractual arrangement \nbetween t he parties, and accounted for accordingly.  \n37. Once the Murabaha or deferred payment sale transaction is consummated:  \na. Hamish Jiddiyyah, being in the nature of a security deposit, shall continue to be presented as a \nliability and shall not be set-off against the receivables unless contractually agreed with the \nbuyer; and  \nb. Urboun, being in the nature of an advance payment, shall be netted off against the \nreceivables.  \nCharity  \n38.

Additionally, the Shari\u2019ah standard on Tawarruq allows such transactions in \nspecific situations (as last resort) and discourages their common use  on a commercial basis .  \nBC3 Considering the above factors, the Board decided that it will be more appropriate to finalize the \nstandard on Murabaha and other deferred payment sales first, and then develop the standard on \nTawarruq and commodity Murabaha transactions ensuring accounting treatments better reflecting \nthe same, as well as, differentiated from normal Murabaha and deferred  payment sales \ntransactions.  \nScope  inclusion and standard  supersession \u2013 other deferred payment sales  \nBC4 The Board discussed the need for a separate standard (existing FAS 20) for deferred payment sales \ntransactions and evaluated the similarity in major accounting treatments and minor differences. \nAfter due consideration, the Board decided that the key principles for all deferred payment sales \ntransactions including Murabaha from the economic substance point of view remain the same and \naccordingly, simila r accounting treatment shall be followed insofar a deviation is not required by \nShari\u2019ah or by the structure of the transaction (like for example in case of a Murabaha by making \nthe profit and cost known, which may change a few minor treatments). This howe ver shall not \ninclude Tawarruq and commodity Murabaha transaction s which were scoped out (see BC1 \u2013 BC3). \nAccordingly, the Board decided that the revised standard shall include Murabaha and other \ndeferred payment sales transactions and shall supersede the existing FAS 2 and FAS 20.  \nUsing the term inventory  \nBC5 The Board, in line with the new strategy of accounting standards development, considered the \ndefinition of inventory under the generally accepted accounting principles whereby inventory is an  \nasset  held for sale in the ordinary course of business  or in the process of production for such sale . \nWhile previously no FAS was using the term inventory to describe the underlying assets for trading \ntransactions, the Board decided that in order to depict the tr ue nature of such assets held for sale, \nand to bring the accounting treatments closer to the generally accepted accounting principles it \nwould be more appropriate to describe them as inventory . \n19 \n NRV and determining NRV  \nBC6 The Board considered the earlier a ccounting treatment of \u201ccash equivalent value\u201d for Murabaha \ninventory (earlier called Murabaha assets) and other possible treatments like \u201cfair value\u201d or \u201cfair \nvalue less cost to sell\u201d for the purpose of testing for any decline in value of such inventory. After \ndue deliberations, the Board decided it would be more appropriate to record the inventories at the \nlower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) term to keep it close to the generally accepted \naccounting principles. The Board was of the view that sinc e these are to be sold in the normal \ncourse of business hence the entity specific NRV is the appropriate accounting treatment in case of \na decline in value against cost. It was also considered that if a credit -worthy customer has provided \na promise to purc hase at a price which is cost plus profit, then a downward adjustment for NRV is \nnot needed, even if the market value of the inventory has declined, because technically the NRV for \nthe institution is above the cost.  \nRecognition of revenue and cost of sales  \nBC7 Previously the requirements with regard to the recognition and disclosure of gross revenue and \ncost of sales were not very clear. While the specimen formant provided in FAS 1 required a \ndisclosure with a statement in the notes to the financial stateme nts along with a clarification in this \nrespect  and since it was not clearly required in FAS 2, a number of institutions were not applying \nthis practice. The Board discussed this issue at length including the definition of revenue and \ndecided that the gross  increase of in assets resulting from trading activities shall be considered as \nrevenue of the institution. Similarly, the Board decided that de -recognition of inventory (along with \nother relevant expenses) shall be considered as cost of sales for the inst itution. That being said, the \nBoard decided to continue the accounting for deferment and recording of profits in the books of \nthe seller for transactions involving a credit.  \nBC8 However, considering the nature of the business of IFIs, the Board decided that the sales and cost \nof sales for such transactions shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements instead of \ndirectly shown as turnover.  \nTransitional provisions  \nBC9 The Board considered certain practical difficulties in application of certain requirements of the \nrevised standard which may impact the accounting and computer systems , particularly, with regard \nto the revenue recognition and the deferred profit amortiza tion. Accordingly, the Board decided to \nallow the institutions a choice to apply this standard on a prospective basis for transaction \nexecuted on or after the effective date.   \n20 \n Recording receivables at gross amount  \nBC10 The Board decided to carry the general accounting treatment with regard to the recording of \nreceivables at gross amount to disclose full amount of Dain receivable and to show the deferred \nprofit or allowance for credit losses (or provision) as contra asset s. The Board concluded that the  \namount of Dain is necessary to be disclosed for several reasons primarily driven by Shari\u2019ah \nincluding determination of Zakah, determination of transferability of an asset or a pool of assets, \ndetermination of tradability of  the shares of the institution and to disclose the full legal right of the \ninstitution against the debtor.  \nJustification  of deferment of profits for the seller  \nBC11  The Board discussed at length the accounting treatment with regard to deferment of the pro fits in \nthe hand of the seller in case of a credit Murabaha or any other deferred payment sale as allowed \nby earlier FAS 2 and FAS 20. The Board apprised that while a few may argue that the ideal \ntreatment is to recognize the profit upfront because it is a  profit and a receivable from Shari\u2019ah \nperspective, yet, it would not be fair and equitable, and at time prudent, to record whole amount \nof profits upfront.  \nBC12  Accordingly, the Board held its view in line with the earlier standards, that since IFIs have  multiple \nstakeholders (including shareholders, who change hand at times, and the investment account \nholders, who all contribute for the transaction and at time change hands)  it would be more just, \nfair and equitable if the profits are deferred and amortiz ed over the period of the whole \ntransaction (i.e. till credit period). Additionally, the Board also apprised that although it is not \nobligatory to give discount in case of early payment, but it is permissible (though not as a common \npractice) and at times customary (including because of regulatory requirements, or because of view \nof certain scholars)  to give a discretionary discount , hence it would be more prudent if the profit is \namortized over the credit period.  \nBC13  The Board concluded that under the tr eatment proposed, the revenues earned by the institution \nare recognized in line with Shari\u2019ah and taking the whole amount of profits to statement of income \nand distributing the same immediately is not a mandatory Shari\u2019ah requirement. Accordingly, the \ndefe rred profit is not considered a liability of the institution and is treated more like a reserve \n(which is earned from Shari\u2019ah perspective, but not necessarily taken to income for distribution \npurposes, for the want of fairness, justice, equity and prudenc e). The Board further concluded that \nreporting the same as a contra asset would reflect better presentation as all the relevant amounts \nshall be presented at the same place (note) in the financial statements.  \nMethod  of amortization of the deferred profits  \nBC14  The Board discussed the methods of recognition of deferred profits and concluded that it would be \nmore appropriate to not allow the earlier allowed alternative treatment of recognition of deferred \nprofits on recovery basis  as it was of the view that this is not in line with the Framework, or in line \nwith the generally accepted accounting principles . Instead , the Board decided that the time \nproportionate allocation is the most suitable method to achieve the objectives of fai r, just, \nequitable and prudent profit sharing amongst stakeholders. The Board further discussed the \n21 \n suitable approach to apply the time proportionate method and after due deliberations, decided \nthat the effective rate of return method shall be the best app roach to apply the time proportionate \nbasis of profit allocation, particularly for long term transactions, and that this method will provide \nbetter matching to the return on investment account holders funds. The Board decided that there \nis no Shari\u2019ah obje ction on the same, because it is merely a method of allocation of profits (which \nare already earned) over a period to provide just, fair and equitable return to the stakeholders.  \nBC15 The Board further discussed and decided to allow a simplified approach ( which was the preferred \napproach , in view of a few members)  for applying the time proportionate method . Under the \nsimplified approach the straight line allocation of profits is allowable for all short -term single bullet \npayment transactions i.e. the transa ctions other than those with installments or those with lump \nsum payment at the end, with original maturity of more than 12 months.  \nAccounting for the buyer \u2013 profit element in the asset value  \nBC16 The Board further discussed the matter of the profit elem ent in the cost of asset in the hand of a \nbuyer in a Murabaha (credit) or other deferred payment sale transaction. Certain members were of \nthe view that the Board shall consider devising a mirror accounting for this purpose of the \naccounting in the hand of  the seller; suggesting that the same would be closer to the generally \naccepted accounting principles , arguing that it is not against Shari\u2019ah . In addition,  they suggested \nthat it will avoid \u201cover -pricing\u201d of the assets in the hand of the buyer. The Board considered and \nevaluated the matter and also consulted certain Shari\u2019ah scholars on this matter and concluded \nthat the justifications available for deferment of the profit in the hand of the seller i.e. (i) fair, just \nand equitable distribution of profits amongst stakeholders; and (ii) prudence, are not available in \nthis case hence it may not be concluded that there is no Shari\u2019ah issue in the mirror accounting. \nAdditionally, the Board considered that the matter of over -pricing can be catered through the \nsuggested approaches of impairment and NRV testing etc. This view was confirmed  by the \n\u201cCommittee of Shari\u2019ah Board for Review of Accounting, Auditing, Governance and Ethics \nStandards\u201d  \nBC17 The Board further concluded that the issue related to Tawarruq and c ommodity Murabaha, \nparticularly in treasury, is a bit different from an economic substance perspective and hence the \nsame shall be considered under a separate standard and hence scoped out.  \n  \n22 \n Appendix C: Brief History of the Preparation of the Standard  \nH1 The newly formed AAOIFI Accounting Board (AAB) held its first meeting  on 6 and 7  Jumada II  \n1437H, corresponding to 15 and 16 March 2016 at Ramee Grand Hotel, Kingdom of Bahrain. In this \nmeeting the contents  of revised draft FAS2 on Murabaha was discussed , on which the work had \nbeen commenced prior to formation of the Board by appointment of a consultant and several \nmeetings of the Accountings Standards Committee of the earlier board . The attendees discussed a \nnumber of issues pertaining to formatting  and pr esentation style , definitions, implementation and \napplication guidelines, formation of working group, consistency with international standards, \ndepreciation methods (for Murabaha assets), and consistency in accounting treatment on both \nsides of the balance  sheet.  A working group were  formed to continue working on the standard and \nspecific guidance was provided to the consultant and the Secretariat in this respect.  \nH2 The second meeting of the Board was held on 25 and 26  Shawwal 14 37H, corresponding to 30 an d \n31 July 2016 at Al Baraka Banking Group  Head Office , Kingdom of Bahrain.  In this meeting the \nBoard discussed the draft FAS2 standard on Murabaha and reviewed and approved of the \nMurabaha Consultation Notes. The members agreed to change the title of the standard from \n\u2018Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer\u2019 to \u2018Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales\u2019  \nH3 AAB held its third meeting on 22 and 23  Dhul -Hijjah 1437H, corresponding to 24 and 25  September \n2016 at AAOIFI Office, Kingdom of Bahrain. In this meeting, the board discussed the draft along \nwith remarks  and comments submitted by the C hairman of the respectiv e working group.  The \nBoard contemplated the need to merge FAS 2 and FAS 20 into a comprehensive standard on \nMurabaha and Deferred Payment Sales as well a s the possibility  to develop a separate standard on \nTawarruq and Commodity Murabaha . The Board finalized all amendments to be made to the \nexposure draft, including the set of definitions to be included, the terminologies that require \namendment and the disclosures and break -downs that need to be added to the final version of the \nStandard.  \nH4 AAB held its fourth meeting on  16 and 17 Rabi\u2019 II  1438H,  corresponding to 15 and 16 January 2017 \nat the premises of Islamic Development Bank (IDB), Jeddah, Kingdom o f Saudi Arabia. In this \nmeeting, the  exposure draft of the standard was approved for issuance for comments and public \nhearing, whereby the working group and the secretariat were directed by the Board to issue the \nexposure draft after ensuring the improveme nts identified by the Board . \nH5 The fifth AAB meeting on 19 and 20 Jumada II 1438H,  corresponding to 18 and 19  March 2017 at \nthe premises of AAOIFI Head Off ice, Manama, Kingdom of Bahrain  discussed  Tawarruq and \ncommodity Murabaha . It was agreed  to be scope d out due to complications associated with these \nsales . The accounting treatment and financial reporting for Tawarruq and Commodity Murabaha \nwas decided  to be in a separate standard .  \nH6 The Public hearing for Murabaha was conducted in the months from Rajab to Ramadan 1438H , \ncorresponding to April to June 2017 in the Kingdom of Bahrain, Pakistan, Jordon and UAE.  \nH7 The working group meeting was held on 28 Dhul -Hijjah  1438 H, corresponding to 19 September \n2017  to present the comments received from the pu blic hearing event and other industry experts.  \n23 \n H8 The standard was approved as finalized at AAB seventh meeting held from  2 \u2013 4 Muharram 1439H, \ncorresponding to 22 \u2013 23 September 2017 at the premises of AAOIFI Head Office, Seef District, \nKingdom  of Bahrain.   \n  \n \n ", "istisna": "Financial Accounting Standard No. (10) Financial Accounting Standard No. (10)\nIstisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a Istisna\u2019a and Parallel Istisna\u2019a \n365365Contents Contents\nSubject Subject Para.

\u201cIjarah\u201d  is set out in paragraph 01 -112. All the paragraphs have equal \nauthority. This standard should be read in the context of its objective and the Conceptual Framework for \nFinancial Reporting as endorsed by AAOIFI.  \n \nAll AAOIFI FAS s shall be read in conjunction with the definitions, Shari\u2019ah principles and rules and key \nconsiderations provided by AAOIFI Shari\u2019ah standards in respect of such products and matters.  \n  \n6 \n Preface  \nPR1 Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek  (Ijarah MBT)  in their  different forms are amongst the most \ncommon Islamic finance transactions. These are used commonly by Islamic financial institutions (the \ninstitution s) for providing assets to customers in need of financial resources for acquiring such assets \nin different sectors. A significant proportion of underlying assets in Sukuk structures are also based on \nsuch transactions.  \nPR2 AAOIFI A ccounting Board (AAB  / the Board ), in its strive for improvements of the existing financial \nrepor ting standards, decided to revise the existing Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 8 \u201cIjarah \nand Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d in order to address the issues faced by the market and observations \nnoted over the past several years, as well as, to improve t he existing accounting treatments in line \nwith the global best practices. This standard accordingly supersedes the existing FAS 8 \u201cIjarah and \nIjarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d .  \nPR3 This standard brings a fundamental shift in the accounting approach for Ijarah trans actions, \nparticularly, in the hand of the lessee. In contrast to the earlier accounting approach of the off-balance \nsheet  accounting for Ijarah, the new standard prescribes an altogether different model of accounting \nin the hand of lessee which entails recognition of  the lessee \u2019s unencumbered right to the benefits \nfrom the use of the asset as  \u2018right -of-use asset \u2019 and its corresponding liability.  \nPR4 It is expected that the new standard will improve the overall accounting and financial reporting \npractices of th e Islamic finance industry and  will bring  the same closer to the global best practices, \nwithout any compromise on Shari'ah principles or the essence of the transaction.  \n  \n7 \n Introduction  \nOverview  \n This standard improves upon and supersedes AAOIFI\u2019s Financial A ccounting Standard (FAS) No. 8 \n\u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d  originally issued in 1997 . This standard aims at setting out \nprinciples for the classification, recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of Ijarah type \ntransactions including their different forms entered into by an institution , in both the capacities of \nlessor and le ssee . \nRationale for issuing this standard  \n The AAOIFI  Accounting Board (AAB/ the Board) , after its  constitution in 2015, approved a strategy and \nplan for improvement in and revision of a significant number of existing FAS s. Revision of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah \nand Ija rah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d was already on agenda of the earlier Board, and a limited scope \nrevision was already under discussion at the accounting standards committee. However, considering \nthe expected changes , at that time,  in the generally accepted account ing principles with regard to \nlease accounting1, it was decided that the standar d revision shall be made duly considering the \nprincipal changes in accounting  by the global accounting standard setters .  \n The Board was also mindful of the fact that eliminatin g or reducing  the financial reporting \nrequirements with regard to any demonstrable differences between Ijarah and Ijarah MBT  against \nconventional leases will jeopardize the sanctity of the transaction \u2019s financial reporting and may also \nadversely impact the reputation of the Islamic finance industry .  \n A review of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d and preliminary study on the topic duly \nconsidering the above factors identified that there were needs for improvement in the same in line \nwith the changes in the industry and the global best practices of accounting. Certain observations and \ncomments of certain terminology and approaches used in the said standard were noted from the \nShari'ah perspective as well. Accordingly, the Board decided to  issue a revised standard on the subject \nof Ijarah.  \nSignificant changes from previous standard  \n This standard (FAS 32) brings significant changes from its predecessor standard (FAS 8), inter alia, in \nthe following aspects:  \na. changes in the classification. Ij arah transactions under in this standard are classified into the \nfollowing :  \ni. Operating Ijarah ;  \nii. Ijarah MBT with expected transfer of ownership after the end of the Ijarah term \u2013 \neither through a sale or gift; and \n \n1 Both the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and US Financial Accounting Standards Board (US FASB) were \nworking on a converged project for revision and improvement in accounting for leases, and exposure drafts of the \nstandards were issued. The  project resulted in both bodies revising their respective standards, principally on the same \nlines although they still maintain differences in respect of certain accounting issues.  \n8 \n iii. Ijarah MBT with gradual transfer \u2013 with gradual transfer ownership during the Ijarah \nterm including Diminishing Musharaka Ijarah ; \nb. new recog nition and measurement principles for initial recognition for right -of-use asset , \nIjarah liability and advance payments for lessee and lessor accounting ; \nc. requirement to identify and separate Ijarah and non-Ijarah components , if needed;  \nd. new recognition and measurement principles for an Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer / \nDiminishing Musharaka Ijarah , whereby  the lessee shall recognize the \u2018combined asset\u2019 \n(including the right -of-use asset and the proportionate asset already owned by  the lessee ) \nwhereas the lessor shall recognize the proportionate asset owned.  FAS 8 requirement s of \nrecording monthly depreciation and gain and loss for such transactions are done away with;  \ne. allowing effective rate of return/ profit rate method for accounting for r ental income, in the \nhand of the lessor;  \nf. testing for impairment of right -of-use asset shall be subject to requirement s of FAS 30 \n\u201cImpairment, Credit Losses and Onerous Commitments\u201d ; and \ng. detailed guidelines are provided for presentation and disclosures with  enhanced disclosure by \nlessor and lessee of information as compared to previous requirements in FAS 8.  \n  \n9 \n AAOIFI  Financial Accounting Standard 32  \nIjarah  \nObjective of the standard  \n1. The objective of this standard is to set out principles for the classificati on, recognition, measurement, \npresentation and disclosure for Ijarah (asset Ijarah, including different forms of Ijarah Muntahia \nBittamleek ) transactions entered into by the Islamic financial institutions (the institution s) on both \nends of the transaction i.e. as a lessor and lessee . An institution shall consider the terms and \nconditions of the contracts and all relevant facts and circumstances when applying this standard and  \nshall apply the same on a consistent basis .  \nScop e \n2. This standard shall apply for accounting and financial reporting for a lessor or lessee, for all Ijarah \n(asset Ijarah, including Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek  (Ijarah MBT) ) transactions  unless specifically \nexcluded under paragraph  3.  \n3. This standard shall no t be applied for accounting of:  \na. Sukuk based on Ijarah which shall be subject to accounting under respective FAS;  \nb. Ijarah transactions  for exploration , extraction, harvesting and otherwise use and sale of \nnatural resources ; and  \nc. service Ijarah transaction s including  employment /  labour contracts and hiring of professional \nservices  and other service based contracts  (not involving tangible assets) , including intellectual \nproperty  and detachable rights.  \nDefinitions  \n4. For the purpose of interpreting and applying this standard, the following short definitions are \nrelevant:  \na. Combined asset \u2013 is an underlying asset subject to Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer, or any \nother form of Ijarah MBT, in which proportionate ownership and right -of-use co -exist on the  \nsame asset;  \nb. Commencement date \u2013 is the date on which the lessor makes an underlying asset available for \nuse by the lessee , in a condition suitable for intended purpose and use;  \nc. Contract \u2013 is an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceab le rights and \nobligations;  \nd. Control \u2013 an institution controls an asset or business, when it has substantially all risks and \nrewards incidental to ownership of such asset or business, duly meeting both of the following \nconditions:  \ni. it is directly exposed to,  or has rights to, variable returns  (negative or positive, \nrespectively)  from its involvement with such assets or business; and  \nii. it has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the assets or business;  \ne. Deferred Ijarah cost \u2013 shall be as def ined in paragraph 29; \n10 \n f. Diminishing Musharaka (Shirkat -ul-Milk) Ijarah \u2013 is a hybrid Ijarah product similar to \u2018Ijarah \nMuntahia Bittamleek through gradual transfer\u2019 comprising of:  \ni. a co-ownership in which two parties  share the ownership of a tangible asset in  an \nagreed proportion  (without intention to engage in common business with respect to \nsuch asset ); and  \nii. a promise under which one of the co -owners undertake s to buy in periodic \ninstallments the proportionate share of the other co -owner until the ownership / title \nto such tangible asset is completely transferred to the purchasing co -owner  (whereby \neach transaction takes place as a sale); and  \niii. a separate Ijarah c ontract, whereby one co -owner (lessor) rents out its proportionate \nshare in the asset to the other co -owner  (lessee) ; \ng. Effective rate of return method [also referred to as effective profit rate method] \u2013 is a method \nof allocating income from an asset or ven ture uniformly, and equitably over the contractual \n(or expected) period of expected benefit from the asset or continuity of venture. This method \nallocates the cash flows from asset or venture through a uniform rate of return including all \ncash flows consid ering all contractual terms (or best expectations) excluding expected future \nlosses. Any fee paid or received, the transaction costs, premiums or discounts are included in \nthe cash flows insofar as these are part of the base contract, or are ancillary cost s; \nh. Fair value \u2013 is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in \nan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date;  \ni. Fixed Ijarah rentals \u2013 are fixed Ijarah rentals paid by a lessee to a lessor  for the right to use an \nunderlying asset during the Ijarah term, excluding variable Ijarah rentals , and include in -\nsubstance fixed Ijarah rentals ;  \nj. Forward Ijarah (Ijarah Mawsufah fi al -Dhimma) \u2013 is an Ijarah c ontract for an unidentified  (and \nat times, pr esently non -existent)  asset undertaken by the lessor to be delivered to the lessee \naccording to the agreed specifications ;  \nk. Hamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit) \u2013 is the amount deposited  as a security against fulfillment \nof a contract , or promise,  or comple tion of a transaction  by one of the parties to other ; \nl. Ijarah \u2013 is a contract, or part of contractual arrangement , that transfers the usufruct of an \nasset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for an agreed consideration , from \na lessor (the owner of the underlying asset) to a lessee. I t has three major elements:  \ni. a form  \u2013 which  includes an offer and an acceptance;  \nii. two parties  \u2013 a lessor  and a lessee; and  \niii. the object of the (Ijarah) contract  \u2013 which  includes the rental amount and t he service \nbenefit ; \nm. Ijarah contract modification \u2013 is a change (with mutual consent of the parties) in the scope of \nan Ijarah, or the consideration for an Ijarah, that was not part of the original terms and \nconditions of the Ijarah (for example, adding or terminating the right to use one or more \nunderlying assets, or extending or shortening the contractual Ijarah term);  \n11 \n n. Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek  (Ijarah MBT)  \u2013 is a hybrid Ijarah arrangement which, in addition to \nthe Ijarah contract, includes a promise resu lting in transfer of the ownership of the underlying  \nasset to the lessee, either after the end of the term of the Ijarah period or by stages during the \nterm of the contract. Such transfer of the ownership is executed through a sale or a gift , or a \nseries o f sales transactions  \u2013 independent of Ijarah contract ; \no. Ijarah rentals (Ujra) \u2013 represent consideration due to the lessor from lessee against transfer of \nthe usufruct (right -of-use) and includes fixed rentals including in-substance  fixed  rentals , and \nvariable rentals, but does not include any consideration paid or promised for transfer of \nownership or proportionate ownership, either as lump sum or as a gradual payment  or as a \nresidual value guarantee ;  \np. Ijarah term \u2013 represents the binding  period covered by the Ijarah contract, as well as, the \nreasonably certain optional periods (see paragraph 13); \nq. Initial direct costs \u2013 are the incremental costs of executing an Ijarah transaction incurred \nsolely and necessarily for the purpose of execution  of the Ijarah transaction e.g. costs borne \nby the lessor on feasibility study, credit assessment or documentation  etc. These do include \nany regulatory costs borne by a manufacturer or dealer lessor for entering an Ijarah MBT \ntransaction ; \nr. In-substance fixe d Ijarah rentals \u2013 in-substance fixed Ijarah rentals are rentals that may, in \nform, contain variability but that, in substance, are unavoidable  but do not include any \ncondition s against  sale or transfer of ownership of the underlying asset ; \ns. Lessee \u2013 is a party in Ijarah contract  that acquires the usufruct of an underlying asset for a \nperiod of time in exchange for  an agreed  consideration ; \nt. Lessor  \u2013 is a party in Ijarah contract that transfers the usufruct of an underlying asset for a \nperiod of time in exchange for an agreed consideration ; \nu. Onerous commitment \u2013 is a commitment, in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the \nobligations under the commitment, exceed the economic benefits expected to be received \nunder it;  \nv. Operating Ijara h \u2013 is an Ijarah that is not accompanied with an option of transfer of ownership \nof the underlying asset to the lessee;  \nw. Residual value of right -of-use assets (for lessee) \u2013 is the amount, if any, expected to be \nrecovered for these ass ets computed in accordance with paragraph 37; \nx. Residual value of underlying assets (for lessor) \u2013 is the amount which is expected to be \nrecovered for these assets at the end of their useful life, net of the expected cost of disposal. \nResidual value of under lying assets is to be estimated at the commencement of the Ijarah;  \ny. Right -of-use asset (usufruct asset) \u2013 is a kind of  intangible asset s that represents a lessee\u2019s \nlegally enforceable right -of-use (or control of usufruct) of an underlying asset (normally b eing \na tangible asset) for the Ijarah term, and includes a \u2018combined asset\u2019 for the purpose of \napplication of this standard;  \nz. Short -term Ijarah  \u2013 is an operating Ijarah that, at the commencement date, has an Ijarah term \nof 12 months or less ; \n12 \n aa. Sub-Ijarah \u2013 is an Ijarah transaction for which an acquired right -of-use asset is transferred  on \nan independent Ijarah basis by a lessee (\u2018intermedia ry lessor\u2019) to a third party, and the original \nIjarah contract (\u2018head -Ijarah\u2019) between the head -lessor and lessee remains  in effect;  \nbb. Underlying asset \u2013 is an asset that is the subject of a n Ijarah contract , for which the usufruct \nhas been transferred by a lessor to a lessee ;  \ncc. Useful economic life \u2013 is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use or \nthe number of production units or usage units etc. expected to be obtained / utilized  from an \nasset;  \ndd. Usufruct  \u2013 is a legally enforceable limited  right  related to an asset including the two property \ninterests of  (i) usus  (use), being the right to use or enjoy  such asset  and (ii) fructus  (fruit), \nbeing the right to derive  profit  or benefit from such asset , but does not entail risks and \nrewards incidental to ownership ; and \nee. Variable Ijarah rentals \u2013 are the portion of rentals paid by a lessee to a lessor for th e right to \nuse an underlying asset during the Ijarah term that varies because of changes in facts or \ncircumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the lapse of time  (see \nparagraph 26) . \nIdentifying (and separating) an Ijarah  \n5. At inception of a contract, an institution shall assess whether the contract is, or contains, a n Ijarah. A \ncontract is, or contains, an Ijarah if the contract transfers the usufruct (but not control ) of an identified \nasset for a period of time in exchange for an agreed consideration. Where applicable, the period of \ntime may be agreed in terms of usage factors, rather than the lapse of time factor alone.  \n6. An institution shall reassess whether  a contract is, or contains, an Ijarah  only if the terms and \ncondit ions of the contract are changed.  \nSeparating components within the Ijarah contract \u2028 \n7. For a contract that is, or contains, a n Ijarah , an institution shall account for each Ijarah  component \nwithin the contract as a n Ijarah separately from non -Ijarah  componen ts (e.g. service fee, maintenance \ncharges, toll manufacturing charges etc.) of the contract, unless the institution applies the simplified \napproach  as defined  in paragraph 10.  \n8. Unless the simplified approach under paragraph 10 is applied, a lessee shall ac count for non -Ijarah \ncomponents applying relevant FAS, or generally accepted accounting principles, in absence thereof, \nsubject to the condition that such accounting policy shall be in line with the Shari'ah principles and \nrules.  \nLessee  \n9. For a contract that contains an Ijarah component and one or more additional Ijarah or non -Ijarah \ncomponents, a lessee shall allocate the consideration in the contract to each Ijarah component on the \nbasis of the relative estimated stand -alone price of the Ijarah component and the aggregate estimated \nstand -alone price of  the non -Ijarah components , that may be charged by the lessor, or a similar \nsupplier, to the lessee .  \n10. As an alternate , a lessee may adopt a simplified approach whereby the lessee may elect , by class of \nunderlying asset, not to separate non -Ijarah  components from Ijarah  components, and instead \n13 \n account for each Ijarah  component and any associated non -Ijarah  components as a single Ijarah  \ncomponent.  \nLessor  \n11. For a contract that contains a n Ijarah component and one or more additional Ijarah or non -Ijarah \ncomponents, a lessor shall allocate the consideration in the contract to each Ijarah and non -Ijarah \ncomponent (performance obligation identified in the contract) on an estimated relative stan d-alone \nprice basis. In case of similar characteristics of different Ijarah components, the lessor may opt to \nconsider the same as a single Ijarah component.  \nClassification of Ijarah  \n12. An institution, in its capacity either as a lessor or lessee, shall class ify each of its Ijarah as:  \na. an operating Ijarah  (see paragraph 4(v));  \nb. an Ijarah MBT  (see paragraph 4(n)) , including the following types:  \ni. an Ijarah MBT  \u2013 with expected transfer of ownership after the end of the Ijarah term  \u2013 \neither through a sale or a gift ; or \nii. an Ijarah MBT  with gradual transfer \u2013 with gradual transfer of ownership during the \nIjarah  term  (including Diminishing Musharaka Ijarah) . \nIjarah  term \n13. An institution, in its capacity of either a lessor or lessee, shall determine the Ijarah term,  including the \ncontractually binding  period  (which may be denoted  in terms of units of production or consumption) , \nas well as, the reasonably certain optional  periods  including : \na. extension option s (periods  covered by an option to extend the Ijarah ) \u2013 if it is reasonably \ncertain that the lessee will exercise that option; and / or  \nb. termination option s (periods covered by an option to terminate the Ijarah ) \u2013 if it is reasonably \ncertain that the lessee will not exercise that option.  \nAssessment of probability of exercising the extension  (including non -termination)  options  \n14. In assessing the probability of ext ension of Ijarah term in lin e with paragraph 13(a) or 13(b), an \ninstitution  shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for \nsuch extension, including the following:  \na. as to whether the contractual terms and condition s for the optional periods are at market \nrates, such as:  \ni. the amount of rentals  for the Ijarah  in any optional period;  \nii. the amount of any variable rentals  for the Ijarah  or other contingent payments, such \nas payments resulting from termination penalties and promise to purchase ; and  \niii. the terms and conditions of any options that are exercisable after optional periods \n(for example, a purchase option that is exercisable at the end of an extension period \nat a rate that is currently below market rates  or transfer of  asset through gift ); \nb. significant improvements over the underlying assets (leasehold improvements) undertaken \n(or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the contract that are expected to have \nsignificant economic benefit for the lessee when the option  to extend or terminate the Ijarah , \nor to purchase the underlying asset, becomes exercisable;  \n14 \n c. costs relating to the termination of the Ijarah , such as negotiation costs, relocation costs, costs \nof identifying another underlying asset suitable for the lessee\u2019s needs, costs of integrating a \nnew asset into the lessee\u2019s operations, or termination penalties and similar costs, including \ncosts associated with returning the underlying asset in a contractually specified condition or \nto a contractually specified  location;  \nd. the importance of that underlying asset to the lessee\u2019s operations, considering, for example, \nwhether the underlying asset is a specialized asset, the location of the underlying asset and \nthe availability of suitable alternatives; and  \ne. conditions  associated with exercising the option (i.e. when the option can be exercised only if \none or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist.  \n15. It would generally be considered that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise t he extension option \nif: \na. an option to extend or terminate an Ijarah is combined with one or more other contractual \nfeatures (for example, a promise to purchase ) in a manner that the lessee still pays more or \nless the same amount, in total, as it would other wise pay by exercising the option;  \nb. the binding  period of an Ijarah is very short \u2013 as the exercising of such option would generally \nbe economically more feasible;  \nc. the lessee\u2019s past practice regarding the period over which it has typically used particular  types \nof assets (whether under Ijarah or owned), and its economic reasons for doing so, determine \nthe exercising of the option to be economically more feasible and in line with the lessee\u2019s past \ntrends.  \n16. There is a rebuttable presumption that expressed in tention of the lessee to exercise the extension \noption(s) provides reasonable certainty with regard to extension of Ijarah term.  \nSubsequent re -assessment of Ijarah term   \n17. A lessee shall reassess whether it is reasonably certain to exercise an extension opt ion, or not to \nexercise a termination option, upon the occurrence of either a significant event or a significant change \nin circumstances that:  \na. is within the control of the lessee; and  \nb. affects whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option n ot previously included \nin its determination of the Ijarah  term, or not to exercise an option previously included in its \ndetermination of the Ijarah  term.  \n18. An institution shall revise the Ijarah term if there is a change in either the contractually binding  period \nor reasonably certain optional periods of an Ijarah . For example, the Ijarah term shall be revised if: \na. the lessee exercises an option not previously included in the institution \u2019s determination of the \nIjarah  term;  \nb. the lessee does not exercise an optio n previously included in the institution \u2019s determination of \nthe Ijarah  term;  \nc. an event occurs that contractually obliges the lessee to exercise an option not previously \nincluded in the institution \u2019s determination of the Ijarah  term; or  \nd. an event occurs that contractually prohibits the lessee from exercising an option previously \nincluded in the institution \u2019s determination of the Ijarah  term.  \n15 \n Accounting  and financial reporting  by the lessee  \nInitial r ecognition  \nAdvance rentals paid  \n19. Any rent als paid in advance  by the lessee prior to the commencement date shall be accounted for and \npresented as \u2018advance Ijarah rentals  paid\u2019 . \n20. Once the Ijarah term is commenced, and the gross Ijarah liability and net Ijarah liability are \ndetermined, such advance rentals shall be netted -off with the gross Ijarah liability.  \nInitial recognition  \n21. At the commencement date, a  lessee shall recognize:  \na. a right -of-use (usufruct)  asset; and \nb. a net Ijarah liability , duly comprising of the following elements:  \ni. gross Ijarah liability;  \nii. deferred  Ijarah cost  (shown as a contra -liability) . \nInitial recognition of right -of-use asset  \n22. At the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right -of-use asset at cost.  \n23. The cost of the right -of-use asset shall comprise:  \na. the \u201cprime cost\u201d of the right -of-use asset (determined in line with the paragraph s 31 or 32 ); \nb. any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee; and  \nc. dismantling or decommissioning costs2.  \nInitial recognition of Ijarah liability  \n24. The gross Ijarah liability  shall be initially recognized as gross amount of total Ijarah rentals payable for \nthe Ijarah term.  \n25. At the commencement date, the total Ijarah rentals included in the measurement of the Ijarah liability \ncomprise the following payments for the right to use the underlying asset during the Ijarah  term:  \na. fixed Ijarah rentals less any incentives receivable;  \nb. variable Ijarah  rentals (see paragraph s 4(ee) and 26) including the supplementary rentals  (duly \nmeasure d at best  estimates applying the index rates and other assumptions as of the \ncommencement date ; and \nc. payments of additional rentals , if any, for terminating the Ijarah , if the Ijarah  term reflects the \nlessee exercising an option to terminate the Ijarah, subject to S hari'ah requirements . \n26. Variable Ijarah  rentals  are the Ijarah rentals that depend on an index or a rate . These  include, for \nexample, payments linked to a consumer price index, payments linked to a financial market or \nregulatory benchmark rate or payments th at vary to reflect changes in market rental rates.  These also \ninclude supplementary rentals which are contingent on certain items e.g. rentals additionally charged \nafter  providing certain additional services or after  incurring major repair and maintenance.  \n \n2 Dismantling or decommissioning costs, if any, shall be accounted for in  line with the generally accepted accounting \nprinciples, subject to necessary Shari'ah approvals.  \n16 \n Special considerations for Ijarah MBT  through gradual transfer  \n27. In case of Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer, or any other form of Ijarah MBT, in which \nproportionate ownership and right -of-use co -exist on the same asset, the lessee shall account for the \ncombined asset under Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer, compri sing of the proportionate:  \na. right -of-use asset; and  \nb. ownership of the tangible asset.  \n28. A combined asset under Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer shall be accounted for in a manner \nsimilar to a right -of-use asset in line with the requirements of this standard . \nDeferred Ijarah cost  \n29. Deferred Ijarah cost , is the difference between the gross Ijarah liability and the prime cost of right -of-\nuse asset . It shall be initially deferred through a deferred Ijarah cost account.  \n30. Deferred Ijarah cost  account shall b e presented as a contra -liability  (of respective liability ).  \nPrime cost of the right -of-use asset  \nUnderlying asset c ost method  \n31. At the commencement date, t he prime cost of  the right -of-use asset  (except for an operating Ijarah)  \nshall comprise of:  \na. either of : \ni. preferably, the cost of the underlying asset  \u2013 if acquired specifically by the lessor for \nthe purpose of the intended Ijarah transaction ; or \nii. alternatively, the fair value of the underlying asset as of the commencement date  \u2013 if \nnot acquired specifically by the lessor for the purpose of the intended Ijarah \ntransaction or if the cost is not known to the lessee;  \nb. less any expected terminal value of the underlying asset  (at the end of the Ijarah term) , being \neither of:  \ni. the promised v alue  (being nil value, in case of expected gift)  at which the transfer may \ntake place after the end of the Ijarah term; or  \nii. expected fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the Ijarah term , in case of \nabsence of a promised value . \nEstimation based o n liability method  \n32. If, the prime cost of the right -of-use asset may not be determined under the underlying asset cost \nmethod defined in paragraph 31 due to lack of sufficient information  (particularly, in case of an \noperating Ijarah)  the same may be determ ined through estimation based on the fair value of the total \nconsideration paid or payable (i.e. total Ijarah rentals) against the right -of-use asset , under a similar \ntransaction .  \nSubsequent measurement  \nSubsequent measurement of the right -of-use asset  \n33. After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the right -of-use asset at : \na. cost;  \nb. less \u2013 any accumulated amortization ;  \n17 \n c. less \u2013 any accumulated impairment losses;  \nd. add / less \u2013 adjust ment for any effect of Ijarah modification or reassessment specified in \nparagraph s 44-46. \nAmortization of right -of-use asset  \n34. A lessee shall amortize the right -of-use asset from the commencement date to the end of the useful \neconomic life of the right -of-use asset which  coincides with the end of the Ijarah term.  \n35. Amortizable amount of a right -of-use asset shall  be amortized  according to a systematic basis that is  \nreflective of the pattern of utilization of benefits from the right -of-use asset.  \n36. Amortizable amount shall generally represent the cost of a right -of-use asset  less residual value, if \nany. \n37. Residual value of right -of-use asset shall  be equal to : \na. nil value \u2013 in case of : \ni. an operating Ijarah ; or  \nii. an Ijarah MBT through sale at fair value after the end of the Ijarah term ; or  \niii. an Ijarah MBT  that do es not meet the condition specified in paragraph  37(c); or \nb. the estimated \u201cresidual value of the underlying asset \u201d at the end of the Ijarah term \u2013 in case \nof an Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer;  or \nc. the estimated \u201cresidual value of the underlying  asset \u201d at the end of the Ijarah term  less \npromised purchase price  (if any) \u2013 in case of Ijarah MBT  through sale or gift after the end of \nthe Ijarah term , if it is highly likely that the option of transfer of ownership of the underlying  \nasset to the lessee shall be exercised through purchase or gift.   \nImpairment of right -of-use asset  \n38. A lessee shall apply requirements of FAS 30 \u201c Impairment, Credit Losses  and Onerous Commitment s\u201d \nto determine whether the right -of-use asset is imp aired and to account for any impairment loss \nidentified.  The impairment testing shall take into consideration the estimated residual value of the \nasset in line with the paragraph 37(c).  \n39. A lessee shall also assess as to whether any commitment(s)  including promise(s)  to purchase the \nunderlying asset after the end of the Ijarah  term or through gradual transfer is onerous in nature and \nif so, shall account for the same in line with the requirements of FAS 30 \u201cImpairment, Credit Losses \nand Onerous Commitments\u201d.  \nSubsequent measurement of the Ijarah liability  \n40. After the commencement date, a lessee shall measure the net Ijarah liability by:  \na. reducing the carrying amount of the gross Ijarah liability to reflect the Ijarah rentals  made ; \nb. increasing the net carrying amount to reflect return on the Ijarah liability \u2013 by way of \namortization of deferred Ijarah cost ; and  \nc. re-measuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment , changes  or Ijarah contract \nmodifications or to reflect revised Ijarah rentals . \n18 \n 41. The effect of re-measuring  of the carrying amount of Ijarah liability (in line with paragraph 40(c) ) shall \nbe recognized as  a change  in the deferred Ijarah cost  unless a specified requirement of paragraphs 44, \n45 or 46 applies . \n42. Deferred Ijarah cost shall be amortized to income over the Ijarah term on a time proportionate basis. \nIt is a rebuttable presumption that for most Ijarah transa ctions, the appropriate method to apply the \ntime proportion basis shall be the effective rate of return  method.  \n43. After the commencement date, a lessee shall recognize  in income statement , unless the costs are \nincluded in the carrying amount of another asse t (e.g. inventory, property, plant and equipment, \nIstisna\u2019a assets etc.) , both:  \na. amortization of deferred Ijarah cost ; and  \nb. variable Ijarah rentals  (not already included in the measurement of the Ijarah liability) \u2013 as and \nwhen remeasured i.e. when the trigg ering event or condition occur s.  \nIjarah contract modifications  \nChanges in the Ijarah term or future Ijarah rentals  \n44. After the commencement date, a lessee shall account for changes in the Ijarah term or future Ijarah \nrentals  without a change in the right -of-use asset  (except for change in its useful economic life), as \nfollows : \na. change in the Ijarah  term  \u2013 re-calculation and adjustment of the right -of-use asset, the Ijarah \nliability and the deferred Ijarah cost ; or \nb. change in fu ture Ijarah  rentals  only (e.g. resulting from a change in an index or a benchmark \nrate used to determine those rentals ) \u2013 re-calculation of the Ijarah liability and the deferred \nIjarah cost only , without impacting the right -of-use asset .  \nChange in right -of use asset: n ew Ijarah component  \n45. An Ijarah modification  shall be considered as a new Ijarah component to be accounted for as a \nseparate Ijarah  for the lessee, if both  of the following conditions are met : \na. the modification additionally transfers the right to use  of an identifiable  underlying asset (s); \nand \nb. the Ijarah  rentals are increase d corresponding to the additional right -of-use asset . \nChange in right -of use asset: de-recognition of earlier Ijarah and recognition of a new  Ijarah  \n46. For an Ijarah modification that does not meet the criteria provided in paragraph s 44 and 45, the lessee \nshall consider the Ijarah as a modified Ijarah as of the effective date  and shall accoun t for the same as \na new Ijarah transaction . Accordingly,  the lessee shall  recalculate the Ijarah liability , deferred Ijarah \ncost and the right -of-use asset respectively, as if it was a new Ijarah , duly de -recognizing the earlier \nIjarah transaction and balances .  \nExpenses related to underlying asset  \n47. Operational expenses related to underlying asset , including any expenses contractually agreed to be \nborne by the lessee, in line with the Shari\u2019ah principles,  shall be recognized by the lessee on an accrual \nbasis  in the period in which these are incurred .  \n19 \n 48. Major repair and maintenance, Takaful and other expenses incidental to ownership of underlying \nassets, if incurred by the lessee as an agent,  shall be recorded as rec eivable from lessor .  \nRecognition exemptions and simplified accounting for the lessee  \n49. A lessee may elect not to apply the requirements of Ijarah recognition and measurement (in line with \nparagraphs 20 to 48), to: \na. short -term Ijarah  (see paragraphs 51 and 52) ; and  \nb. Ijarah for which the underlying asset is of low value (see paragraph s 53 and 54). \nAccounting for the exempt Ijarah  \n50. In case of exempt Ijarah  (as determined in line with paragraph 49) , the lessee shall recognize the \nIjarah rentals as an expense on either:  \na. a straight -line basis over the Ijarah term; or  \nb. a systematic basis, if considere d better  representative of the pattern of the lessee\u2019s use \nbenefit  of the underlying asset . \nShort -term Ijarah  \n51. In case of short -term Ijarah considered exempt under paragraph 49, the lessee shall re -consider the \nIjarah as a new Ijarah in case of an Ijarah mo dification or a change in the Ijarah term.  \n52. The exemption under paragraph 49, shall be applied to a whole class of underlying assets, that have \nsimilar characteristics and operational utility .  \nLow value Ijarah  \n53. The choice for Ijarah transactions for which the underlying asset is of low value can be made on an \nindividual asset or Ijarah transaction basis  but not on a group / combination basis . The value of an \nunderlying asset shall be considered as of  when it is / was new, irrespective of when the Ijarah \ntransaction  is executed . \n54. The choice provided for in paragraph 53 shall be available if, and only if, the asset is usable for lessee \non its own basis, without needing other resources which are not already available with the l essee or \nbeing dependent or interrelated with, other assets . \nPresentation and disclosure  \nPresentation  \n55. Right -of-use assets and net Ijarah liability shall be presented in the lessee\u2019s statement of financial \nposition as \u2018right -of-use assets\u2019 (between \u2018propert y, plant and equipment\u2019 and \u2018intangible assets\u2019 ) and \nas a liability, respectively .  \n56. Advance Ijarah rentals paid  in respect of Ijarah transaction s yet to commence shall be presented  as \nreceivable.  \n57. Net Ijarah cost shall be presented in the less ee\u2019s income s tatement as a single  \u2018operating expense \u2019 \ncommensurate with the nature of use of the right -of-use asset comprising of , and disclosing \nseparately, the : \na. amortization of right -of-use asset ;  \nb. amortization of deferred Ijarah cost ;  \n20 \n c. variable Ijarah rentals ; and \nd. gain or loss on Ijarah modifications  and other adjustments . \nDisclosures   \n[Explanation: if the Ijarah cost is attributable  to construction / development of an asset then such disclosures \nshall be provided while disclosing such attributions]  \n58. In addition to the disclosure requirements stated in FAS 1: \u201cGeneral Presentation and Disclosure in the \nFinancial Statements of Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions\u201d following are the minimum disclosure \nrequirements in the financial statements of the less ee: \na. the accounting policies adopted for the accounting treatments of Ijarah and Ijarah MBT \ntransactions as a less ee duly  explaining the types of Ijarah transactions the lessee has entered \ninto; \nb. the amount of right -of-use assets by each major class of assets ne t of accumulated \namortization and accumulated impairment, if any , as well as, disclosing the other balances \nincluded or deducted therefrom in line with this standard ; \nc. the breakup of the combined assets acquired under Ijarah MBT through gradual transfer, as  \nregards to the proportionate carrying value of:  \ni. right -of-use asset; and  \nii. tangible asset;  \nd. a summary of, the amount of the gross and net Ijarah liability  \u2013 distributed as per  amount  \ndue: \ni. within next 12 months;  \nii. in more than 12 months, but within next 5 years;  and \niii. in more than 5 years ; \ne. future / potential cash outflows not already  accounted for as  Ijarah  liabilities , e.g.  \ni. ijarah not yet commenced to which the lessee is committed  including prospective/ \nforward Ijarah ; \nii. variable Ijarah rentals ; \niii. ijarah extension op tions ;  \niv. ijarah  termination options;  \nv. commitments / or expected ex ercise of options to purchase, either the underlying \nasset after the end of Ijarah term (in case of Ijarah MBT) or the proportionate \nownership units of the underlying units during the Ijarah term (in case of Ijarah MBT \nthrough gradual transfer) ;  \nf. future cash outflows as required to be disclosed under paragraph 58(e) , shall be preferably \ndisclosed , if material,  with a distributions of cash outflows : \ni. within next 12 months;  \nii. in more than 12  months, but within next 5 years; and  \niii. in more than 5 years ; \n21 \n g. disclosure of nature of assets sold during the period under sale and Ijarah -back transactions  \nand necessary information including:  \ni. sale price;  \nii. carrying value prior to sale;  \niii. gain / loss on execution of sale and Ijarah -back transaction;  \niv. principal terms and conditions of the transaction(s), if considered material;   \nh. unamortized deferred Ijarah costs  against Ijarah liabilities , providing a movement of the same \nduring the period duly disclosed as  a deduction from the outstanding amount of Ijarah \nliabilities ; \ni. outstanding amounts of Hamish Jiddiyyah at the end of the financial period;  \nj. the excess of expected cumulative amount of residual value of right -of-use assets in case of \nIjarah MBT in line with  paragraph 37(c) , which may be subject to contingent impairment in \ncase of either:  \ni. termination of Ijarah MBT; or  \nii. non-execution of the sale or gift transaction after the end of the Ijarah  term ;  \nk. the amount of Ijarah rentals  waived by the lessor , if any,  according to their respective nature, \nduring the period; and \nl. the amount of charity payments made and payable , if any,  against defaults in payments and \nother breaches if any.  \nAccounting and financial reporting by the lessor \nInitial Recognition  \nAdvance to vendor  \n59. Any advance paid by lessor for acquisition of the underlying asset, before the control of the underlying \nasset is transferred to the lessor, shall be recorded and reported as an advance payment to vendor.  \nAdvance rentals received  \n60. Any advance rental s received by lessor in respect of an Ijarah transaction  (including prospective / \nforward Ijarah) , shall be recorded and reported as obligation against advance rentals.  \nTiming of recognition of underlying asset  \n61. Underlying asset shall be recognized in the b ooks of the lessor  once it controls the underlying asset i.e. \nthe time when it essentially acquires substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of such \nunderlying asset.  \nRecognition of underlying asset  \n62. Underlying asset shall be initially re cognized at cost. The cost of underlying asset shall comprise all \ncosts of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the underlying asset to its present location and \ncondition. It includes all types of taxes (other than those subsequently recovered), t ransportation and \nhandling costs including related Takaful cost and all other costs directly attributable to bring the \nunderlying asset to its present location and condition , including those incurred by the customer in \n22 \n capacity of agent and any fee paid to  the agent. Trade discounts, rebates and similar items should be \ndeducted from the costs.  \n63. In cases where underlying asset is acquired on a piecemeal basis or in tranches, each tranche of asset \nreceived shall be recognized when the conditions defined in par agraph 61 are met  with respect to \nsuch tranche .  \nInitial direct  costs  \n64. Transaction costs, not being eligible for inclusion in the cost of underlying asset, duly incurred by the \nlessor for arranging the Ijarah transaction shall be recognized and deferred as initial direct costs.   \n65. Initial direct costs  shall  be allocated to income statement through amortization over the periods in the \nIjarah  term in a pattern consistent with that used for allocating Ijarah revenues.  \nSubsequent measurement  \n66. Subsequent to initial recognition, the underlying assets shall be measured at cost less accumulated \ndepreciation less accumulated impairment, if any.  \nDeprec iation  \n67. Depreciable amount of an underlying asset shall be charged to income over its useful economic life on \na pattern which is reflective of the expected pattern of economic benefits arising from the same.  \nNormally the straight line method can be consider ed as most appropriate pattern of flow of economic \nbenefits, unless another systematic method is determined to  be more appropriately reflecting such \npattern.  \n68. Depreciable amount shall represent the cost of the underlying asset less residual value.  \n69. Residual value in respect of an underlying asset shall represent:  \na. the estimated fair value of the underlying asset at the end of the Ijarah term \u2013 in case of an \noperating Ijarah, or an Ijarah MBT  through sale at fair value after the end of the Ijarah term; or  \nb. nil value \u2013 in case of an Ijarah MBT  through gift after the end of the Ijarah term; or  \nc. the promised sale value \u2013 in case of an Ijarah MBT  through sale at promised sale value after \nthe end of the Ijarah term; or  \nd. the lower of  cost or estimated realizable value \u2013 in case of an Ijarah MBT  through gradual \ntransfer . [Explanation: estimated realizable value to be applicable only if the units\u2019  sale is \ncarried out at fair value, and there is an indication of decline in the realizable value at the time \nof respective prop ortionate unit transfers . Accordingly, there will generally be no depreciation \nof such assets ]. \n70. The useful economic life of the underlying asset shall  generally  represent : \na. the Ijarah term \u2013 in case of all Ijarah  transactions except for those on which paragraph 70(b) \napplie s; or  \nb. period equivalent to the useful economic life of similar assets (including lessor\u2019s own similar \nassets) \u2013 in case of such operating Ijarah transactions whereby, after the end of the Ijara h \nterm, the underlying asset is intended to be used, either for the own use of the lessor , or for \nuse in respect of further (one or more) unrelated operating Ijarah transactions.   \n23 \n Impairment  \n71. An underlying asset shall be subject to the impairment requiremen ts of FAS 30 \u201cImpairment, Credit \nLosses and Onerous Commitments\u201d.  \n72. In case of Ijarah MBT  through gradual transfer , an underlying asset  shall be subject to the provisions \nrelated to net realizable value (NRV) of FAS 30 \u201cImpairment, Credit Losses and Onerous \nCommitments\u201d . \nAccounting for commitments  \n73. Any promises / undertakings made by the lessor in relation to an Ijarah transaction, resulting in an \nonerous commitment shall be accounted for and reported in line with the requirements of FAS 30 \n\u201cImpairment, Credit losses and Onerous Commitments\u201d.  \nIjarah revenue  and costs  \nIjarah revenue  \n74. Ijarah revenue  shall be recognized in income statement of the lessor on an accrual basis, applying, \neither:  \na. a straight -line basis  \u2013 preferred method ; or \nb. another systematic basis.  \n75. The lessor shall apply another systematic basis if it can be established that such basis maybe \nrepresentative of the pattern in which benefit from the use of the underlying asset is diminished.  \nApplying the effective rate of return method  \n76. It is a rebuttable assumption that in various Ijarah MBT  transactions, the effective rate of return \nmethod is better representative of the pattern in which the use of the underlying asset is diminished.  \n77. Under this method, the gross Ijarah re venue is allocated to income statement over the term of Ijarah \nin such a manner that a uniform rate of return is produced in form of net Ijarah revenue, over net \ninvestment in Ijarah assets whereby:  \na. net Ijarah revenue is the amount of gross Ijarah revenue,  net of Ijarah costs (depreciation and \namortization); and  \nb. net investment in Ijarah assets is the net carrying value of the underlying asset, including the \nunamortized initial direct cost.  \n78. While applying the effective rate of return method, any excess of I jarah revenue recognized over the \nIjarah rentals due shall be recognized as accrued Ijarah rentals.  \nApplying the systematic method for Ijarah MBT  through gradual transfer  \n79. It is a rebuttable assumption that in case of Ijarah MBT  through gradual transfer, the most suitable \nsystematic method would be to recognize  Ijarah revenue in the financial period in which it is due,  on \naccrual basis,  taking into consideration that the revenue shall progressively decrease as the lessee \nacquires a greater share of the underlying  asset.  \nIjarah costs  \n80. Ijarah costs, incurred in earning the Ijarah revenue shall be recognized as an expense in the income \nstatement of a lessor.  These include:  \na. depreciation of the underlying asset;  \n24 \n b. amortization of the initial direct cost ; and  \nc. other  costs incidental to ownership of underlying asset e.g. major repair and maintenance \n(other than operational repair and maintenance), Takaful and taxes  etc. \nPresentation and disclosures  \n81. Ijarah assets shall be presented in the lessor\u2019s statement of financia l position as \u2018Ijarah assets \u2019.  \n82. Net Ijarah revenue shall be presented in the lessor\u2019s in come statement comprising of:  \na. gross Ijarah revenue recognized during the period;  \nb. less: depreciation of underlying asset;   \nc. less: expenses related to Ijarah assets including Takaful, registration, legal and repair and \nmaintenance . \n83. Advance Ijarah rentals received shall be recognized and presented as a liability in the lessor\u2019s \nstatement of financial position.  \n84. Initial direct cos ts shall be shown as an addition to the carrying value of the Ijarah assets , reflecting \ntotal initial direct costs and unamortized initial direct costs . \nDisclosures  \n85. In addition to the disclosure requirements stated in FAS 1: \u201cGeneral Presentation and Discl osure in the \nFinancial Statements of Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions\u201d following are the minimum disclosure \nrequirements in the financial statements of the less or: \na. the accounting policies adopted for the accounting treatments of Ijarah and Ijarah MBT \ntransactions as a less or duly  explaining the types of Ijarah transactions the less or has entered \ninto;  \nb. the amount of Ijarah assets by each major class of assets , as well as, by each classification of \nIjarah transactions,  net of (and disclosing s eparately) accumulated depreciation  and \naccumulated impairment, if any, as well as, disclosing the other balances included or deducted \ntherefrom in line with this standard;  \nc. amortization of initial direct costs;  \nd. future cash inflows related to Ijarah transac tions . This includes cash inflows arising from:  \ni. Ijarah rentals;  \nii. extension options and termination options;  \niii. committed  / or expected ex ercise of options to sell, either the underlying asset after \nthe end of Ijarah term (in case of Ijarah MBT) or the proport ionate ownership units of \nthe underlying units during the Ijarah term (in case of Ijarah MBT through gradual \ntransfer);  \niv. commi tted purchases of assets including those ordered, to be procured and given on \nIjarah basis;  \nv. Ijarah rentals related to Ijarah not y et commenced to which the lessee is committed;  \n25 \n e. future cash outflows as required to be disclosed under paragraph 85(d) , shall be preferably \ndisclosed, if material, with a distributions of cash outflows:  \ni. within next 12 months;  \nii. in more than 12 months, but wit hin next 5 years; and  \niii. in more than 5 years.  \nf. outstanding amounts of Hamish Jiddiyyah at the end of the financial period;  \ng. the amount of Ijarah rentals waived by the lessor, if any, according to their respective nature, \nduring the period; and  \nh. the amount of ch arity payments made and payable, if any, against defaults in payments and \nother breaches if any.  \nIjarah MBT : transfer of underlying asset\u2019s ownership  \nTiming of recognition of the transfer of underlying asset  \n86. In case of an Ijarah MBT , the transfer of asset\u2019s ownership may take place through transfer of control \n(entailing risks and rewards incidental to ownership of such asset) under a separate ( i.e. separate from \nthe Ijarah contract):  \na. contract of sale \u2013 after the end of the Ijarah  term (including, in certain circumstances, after \nearly termination of the Ijarah  term); or  \nb. contract of gift \u2013 after the end of the Ijarah  term; or  \nc. contracts of sale of proportionate ownership (generally in form  of ownership units ) \u2013 during \nthe Ijarah  term.  \n87. A contract (s), as referred to in paragraph 86 constitute an offer and acceptance (whereby, either party \nmay offer and other accepts), and shall not be confused with the promise for execution of such \ntransaction, at a future date (which is not binding on one  of the parties, at least).  \n88. Transfer of underlying asset\u2019s ownership (or proportionate ownership) shall be accounted for by both \nparties on transfer of control of the underlying asset to the lessee generally coinciding with the timing \nof consummation of th e relevant contract  (also see paragraph 89).  \nIjarah MBT through g radual  transfer \u2013 special considerations  \n89. Gradual t ransfer of underlying asset\u2019s proportionate ownership shall be accounted  for by both parties  \non transfer of corresponding control of the underlying asset to the lessee coinciding with the timing of  \nconsummation of the relevant contract, through:  \na. offer and acceptance of the transfer of proportionate ownership; or  \nb. payment against purchase of such units as a continuing arrangement  (and accepta nce of such \npayment)  if so allowed by the contract and in line with Shari\u2019ah principles, in absence of \nindividual offer and acceptance against each such transfer .  \n26 \n In the books of the purchaser / transferee (previously  lessee)  \nAfter completion of the Ijarah term  \n90. On acquisition, t he underlying asset acquired, shall be recognized in the books of the purchaser \n(earlier, the lessee) as an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property or any other \ncategory  of assets , as suitable according to the nature of the asset , at: \na. cost, being the consideration paid or payable for the acquisition of asset;   \nb. plus: the carrying value of the right -of-use asset, if any (residual value in line with paragraph \n37) duly reclassified from the right -of-use asset .  \nIjarah MBT through gradual transfer \u2013 special considerations  \n91. The combined asset acquired completely as owned asset , on full transfer of ownership units,  shall be \nreclassified as an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property or any other category \nof assets, as suitable according to the nature of the asset, at  the carrying value (including asset cost, \nless accumulated amortization (now classified as depreciation), less accumulated impairment, if any) . \nDe-recognition i n the books of the seller  / transferor  (previously  lessor)  \n92. The underlying asset\u2019 s sale or gift after the end of the Ijarah term or in case of early termination / \nsettlement shall be recorded by the seller / transferor (being previously the lessor) , the underlying \nasset shall  be de -recognized  and any gain or loss arising on the same being the difference between the \ncarrying value and the consideration received or receivable, shall be recognized in income statement  \ncurrently .  \nIjarah MBT through gradual transfer \u2013 special consi derations  \n93. The proportionate ownership of the underlying asset sold under each distinct transaction of \nownership transfer shall be accounted for in the books of the seller  (earlier, the less or) by recognizing \nthe consideration received or receivable as the  income on unit sales, the corresponding proportionate \ncost at carrying value,  being the cost of sold units while recognizing any gain or loss on such unit sales \nin the income statement currently.  \nTransfer  of underlying  assets with early termination / set tlement  of Ijarah   \n94. In case an Ijarah is prematurely terminated and the underlying asset is transferred by the lessor to the \nlessee, both the transactions shall be accounted for separately in line with the Shari\u2019ah requirements \nand contractual terms. In suc h situation, prior to transfer of underlying asset, the Ijarah contract shall \nbe concluded and any gain or loss on the same shall be recognized in the income statement at the \ntime of termination of the Ijarah contract.  \n95. Once the Ijarah contract is terminate d, transfer of underlying asset, shall be accounted for in \naccordance with paragraph s 96 and 97 .  \nIn the books of the purchaser / transferee (previously  lessee ) \n96. In case of an Ijarah transaction being early terminated and purchase of underlying asset by the \npurchaser (previous ly lessee), the underlying asset acquired shall be recognized in the books of the \npurchaser (earlier, the lessee) as an item of property, plant and equipment or investment property or \nany other category of assets, as suitable accordi ng to the nature of the asset, at:  \n27 \n a. cost, being the consideration paid or payable for the acquisition of asset (but excluding any \nadditional payments made for early settlement / termination of Ijarah, not being a part of \npurchase consideration);  \nb. plus: the carrying value of the right -of-use asset;  \nc. less: impairment identified as a result of early settlement / termination, if any.   \nIn the books of the seller / transferor (previously less or) \n97. In case of an Ijarah transaction being early terminated and sale or gift of underlying asset by the seller \n/ transferor (previously lessor), the underlying asset acquired shall be de-recognized from the books of \nthe selle r / transferor (earlier, the less or) and following shall be recognized, separately , in the income \nstatement currently : \na. gain or loss on early settlement of Ijarah; and  \nb. gain or loss on disposal of Ijarah asset \u2013 being the difference between the consideration \nreceived or receivable (if any) an d the carrying value of the underlying asset . \nSale and Ijarah -back  transactions   \n98. If an institution  (the seller -lessee) transfers an asset to another institution  (the buyer -lessor) and duly \nfulfilling the Shari\u2019ah requirements in this respect, the buyer -lessor unconditionally executes an Ijarah \ntransaction on the same asset back to the same seller -lessee , both the seller -lessee and the buyer -\nlessor shall account for the transfer contract and the Ijarah  applying paragraphs 99-104.  \nSale of the asset  \n99. The sale of the underlying asset from the seller -lessee to the buyer -lessor takes  place when  the \ncontrol of the underlying asset duly entailing the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are \ntransferred to the buyer -lessor.  \n100. The seller -lessee is case of  a proportionate transfer of asset for Ijarah -back, shall measure the right -of-\nuse asset proportion after transfer and acquired -back and recognize  any gain or loss accordingly . \nAccounting for the sale of the asset \u2013 by seller -lessee  \n101. The seller -lessee shall  record the transfer of control of the underlying asset and execution of Ijarah as \ntwo distinct, independent contracts.  This generally includes the legal title as well, unless it can be \nestablished otherwise, that the control is transferred, irrespective o f the legal title not being \ntransferred.  \n102. If the fair value of the consideration for the transfer/ sale of an asset does not approximate  the fair \nvalue of the asset  transferred , any gain or loss arising on the same shall be:  \na. immediately recognized in the i ncome statement \u2013 in case of an operating Ijarah; or  \nb. deferred and amortized over the Ijarah term  \u2013 in case of all other types of Ijarah . \n103. Deferred gain or loss on sale of the asset shall be shown as a deduction from or addition to, \nrespectively, the Ijarah liability.   \n28 \n Accounting for the buyer -lessor  \n104. A buyer -lessor shall account for a sale and Ijarah -back transaction in line with this standard as a \nnormal lessor without any special consideration.  \nOther related accounting treatments  \nForward Ijarah  \n105. In respect of a forward Ij arah transaction, a ny advance payment made by the prospective lessee to \nthe prospective lessor shall be accounted for in line with the paragraph s 19 and 60 by the lessee and \nthe lessor, respectively.  Commitments in respect of forward  Ijarah transactions shall be disclosed in \naccordance with paragraph 58(e)(i) . A forward Ijarah transaction shall be subject to other provisions of \nthe standard, on the commencement of Ijarah.   \nHamish Jiddiyyah (security deposit)  \n106. Subject to the terms of th e contract, the Hamish Jiddiyyah  paid by the lessee  shall be recognized as a \nreceivable from the lessor and shall not be netted -off with the Ijarah liability , unless it is to be \nadjusted against consideration for transfer of ownership  or adjustment against  rental liability if agreed \nupon between the parties, at the time of such event taking place . The lessor shall recognize a \ncorresponding liability for the same.  \n107. Adjustment of, or forfeiture of, Hamish Jiddiyyah, against breach of promise or default or other \nadverse conditions shall be governed by the Shari\u2019ah rules and contractual arrangement between the \nparties and accounted for accordingly.  \n108. Once the Ijarah contract is terminated, Hamish Jiddiyah shall:  \na. either be returned by the lessor to the lessee; o r \nb. shall be adjusted with the sale price  / consideration for the transfer of ownership of the \nunderlying asset  under a specific authorization of the lessee.  \nCharity  \n109. Any charity payment against defaults and delayed payments by the customer shall not be reco gnized \nas an income of the seller and shall be taken directly to charity payable, when received.  \nEffective date  \n110. This standard shall be effective for the financial periods  beginning on or after 01 January 2021 . Early \nadoption is permitted.  \nTransitional provisions  \n111. The institution may opt to apply this standard on a prospective basis for transaction s executed on or \nafter the effective date. If an institution applies this transitional p rovision, it shall disclose a fair \nestimate of the impact of the same.  \nAmendments to other standards  \n112. This standard supersedes the earlier AAOIFI FAS No. 8 \u201cIjarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d.  \n  \n29 \n APPENDICES  \n \nAppendix A: Adoption of the standard  \n \nThis standard was presented for the approval in the AAOIFI Accounting Board\u2019s meeting No. 16 held on 2-3 \nRabi I 1441 H, corresponding to  31 October 2019 and 1 November 2019  and was duly approved.  \nMember s of the Board  \n1.

Ms. Zahra Jassim AlSairafi (AAOIFI)   \n31 \n Appendix B: Basis for conclusions  \nReason for revision of the standard  \nBC1 The AAOIFI Accounting Board (AAB / the Board) deliberated on the need for revision of FAS 8 \u201cIjarah \nand Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek\u201d while developing  its revised plan in 2016, after its reconstitution . It \nwas also noted that a  limited scope revision project for FAS 8  had already been initiated by the \npredecessor board . FAS 8  originally issued in 1997 catered and responded to the need to distinguish  a \nShari\u2019ah compliant lease from a conventional lease  and to prescribe the correc t accounting treatments \nin line with its true nature in line with Shari\u2019ah . However, considering the fact that there had been \nsignificant  evolution of the product and its new and innovative variants had be come more common , it \nwas eminent to review and revi se the standard duly catering to such needs . Accordingly, the Board \ndecided that there is a need to im prove the existing FAS 8.  \nBC2 The Board also considered that globally there have been significant changes in lease accounting more \nrecently including major pr ojects by the IASB and the FASB resulting in their respective new standards, \nwhich are quite similar to each other (initially planned as convergence standards). In line with the new \nAAOIFI strategy for financial accounting standards setting, the Board deci ded that the revised \nstandard shall be as close as possible to the new global accounting standards, duly addressing the \nspecific Shari'ah requirements and the specific structure of Ijarah transactions which is not considered \nby such global standards . \nScope  exclusion \u2013 service  Ijarah  \nBC3 From Shari\u2019ah standpoint  Ijarah has two basic types i.e. asset Ijarah and service Ijarah. Whether or not \nthis standard shall include service Ijarah in its scope was a key question addressed by the working \ngroup as well as the Board , and was raised during public hearing sessions  as well . The Board \nconsidered that the  service Ijarah can be segregated into two types, being human based or technology \nand equipment  based such as, bandwidth, telecommunication minutes etc . Considering the significant \ndifferences in nature  of the two types of Ijarah, t he Board decided that th is standard shall c over  the \nasset Ijarah only. However, the service Ijarah which involves equipment as well, the same shall be \nsubject to this standard as such cont racts will have an Ijarah element subject to the requirements of \nthis standard. For such typ e of transactions, the measurement of usufruct can be performed by unit of \noutput or other such measures.  \nKey distinguishing factors between an Ijarah  MBT  and conventional finance lease  \nBC4 An Ijarah is principally a lease transaction. The issue of differenc e with conventional transactions arise \nonly in the terms and conditions, which are generally attached to a conventional finance lease which \nmake it impermissible from Shari'ah perspective and hence Ijarah MBT is principally different from the \nconventional finance lease.  \nBC5 The Board considered that in an Ijarah MBT, it is a primary condition by Shari\u2019ah that the risks and \nrewards  incidental to ownership are with the lessor throughout the lease term . Whereas, in a finance \nlease , according to its definition,  substantially all risk and rewards incidental to ownership are \ntransferred to the lessee  at inception of lease i.e. in substance it is considered to be a sale. It is worth \nnoting that if substantially all risk and rewards in a lease transaction are transferr ed at inception , the \nsame cannot be termed as Shari\u2019ah compliant . This is because, as per Shari\u2019ah an Ijarah is separate \nfrom the sale or gift transaction , as two contracts (or one contract and one promise) are to be \n32 \n accounted for separately, duly distinguishing the respective risks, rewards and responsibilities of both \nparties. Considering th ese factors , the Board reiterated that the option of accounting for Ijarah MBT \nsimilar to conventional finance lease is not acceptable.  \nBC6 The same issue was discussed in detail at the working group and the Board as well as public hearings \nand was also specifically referred to the Shari\u2019ah board\u2019s committee for review of financial accounting \nand governance standards. After due deliberations, it was decided that fundamentally there shall be \nno difference in accounting for the Ijarah or Ijarah MBT as an Ijarah MBT is essentially an Ijarah \ntransaction and any future commitment f or sale or gift cannot be  combined with the Ijarah contract.  \nBC7 It is also worth noting  that from the economic substance perspective, the subject matter of an Ijarah \ntransaction is the usufruct whereas the subject matter of a conventional finance lease is th e financing. \nThis is the reason that the conventional accounting standards focus on recognition of liability, as the \nprimary requirement.  The Board also took a considered view that the concept of minimum lease \npayment  cannot be applied in line with Shari'a h principles. In Ijarah the \u2018gross Ijarah liability\u2019 comprise \nof the total Ijarah rentals and not total lease payments. In other words, total lease payments under \nconventional accounting standards include guaranteed residual value and other advanced initia l \ndeposits etc. which is not acceptable for Ijarah, duly considering the Ijarah and sale  / gift  as separate \ntransactions.  \nBC8 The Board also considered the nature of a promise for sale and / or gift executable at a future date. \nConsidering various factors incl uding  in particular,  (i) the nature of a unilateral promise / undertaking \nas per Shari\u2019ah , and  (ii) the prohibition of combing two transactions in one , the Board reiterated its \nview taken  earlier at multiple occasions  with regard to such transactions, and decided that they do not \ncombine with the Ijarah transaction and do not change the nature of the Ijarah transaction.  \nKey distinguishing factors - Shari\u2019ah perspective  \nBC9 The above decisions of the Board were based on a thorough analysis of the key distinguishing factors \nbetween an Ijarah MBT transaction and conventional finance lease transactions . Certain key \ndistinguishing factors are listed below:  \na. in Ijarah MBT, during t he lease term, the lessor  carries the operational risks related to ownership \ne.g. theft, destruction, technical obsolescence, unavailability for a period due to major \nmaintenance / repairs etc. , as well as, the Takaful / insurance cost and taxes related to  ownership \nof asset ; \nb. in Ijarah MBT,  during the lease term,  the lessor carries the market risk related to the ownership of \nthe asset i.e. if for any reason the promise is not executed at the future date, the gain or loss in \nvalue of asset relates to the les sor; \nc. in Ijarah MBT, the rentals commence from the time the asset is delivered to the lessee in \ncondition good enough for intended use , and not from the time when the funds are disbursed ; \nd. in Ijarah MBT, no rental is chargeable during the period when asset i s not available for the \nintended use for any reason; and \n33 \n e. in Ijarah MBT the ownership transfer takes place against a unilateral promise which is not binding \non either of the parties  and there are situations when such transfer never takes place e.g. \ndestruct ion or theft of the asset before completion of Ijarah term . \nBC10  The Board also considered the philosoph ical foundations  of Islamic finance. The fundamentals are \nbased on the prohibition of Riba and permission of trade which means that the time value of money i s \nnot acceptable, but the time value of economic resources such as goods, assets, labour and \nentrepreneurship is acceptable. Accordingly, the Board took a considered view that in Ijarah MBT, the \nprice (Ijarah rental) is calculated and charged on the use be nefit of asset rather than time value of \nmoney  (i.e. disbursed financing) . As an example, Ijarah rental cannot be charged and recorded until \nthe underlying asset is in possession of the lessee or if the asset is not available for  intended use for \nany reaso n. In conventional finance lease, on the contrary , the lessor normally commences charging \nand recording interest on the day financing is disbursed even if the asset is not in existence or in \npossession.  \nOperating Ijarah  \nBC11  The Board also noted that there are no significant differences between an operating Ijarah and an \noperating lease. The distinguishing factor being \u2018risks and rewards\u2019 incidental to ownership belongs to \nthe lessor, whereas the use benefit relates to the lessee. Ijarah in essence are considered to be similar \nto an operating lease because of  the \u201crisk and reward\u201d factor.  \nBC12  There are however Shari\u2019ah conditions for permissibility of such transactions i.e. if an Ijarah is Shari\u2019ah \ncompliant in both, form and substance, the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are not \ntransferred to the less ee and as a result Ijarah falls within the definition of an operating lease and its \naccounting should be in line with the same. This issue was debated by the Board and further research \nshowed that most other Islamic finance standard setters have also devel oped their standards for \nIjarah in line with accounting treatment for operating leases.   \nAccounting for usufruct / right -of-use asset  \nBC13  The global accounting standard setters while revisi ng their accounting standard for l easing took a \nfundamental shift , whereby the concept of recognition of right -of-use asset was introduced, even in \ncase of operating leases. The Board agreed with certain major changes that were brought in by such \nstandards . Particularly, the Board agreed that entering into an Ijarah transacti on gives rise to a \u2018right -\nof-use\u2019 asset (which may also be called a usufruct asset) . \nBC14  Accordingly, the Board decided that accounting for usufruct or right -of-use asset in the books of the \nlessee (irrespective of being an Ijarah or Ijarah MBT) would have an even fair and transparent view of \nthe state of affairs. Therefore, the \u2018right -of-use\u2019 asset shall be accounted for as well as the \ncorresponding liability.  \nBC15  It must be noted that the transfer of control of the right -of-use asset to the lessee is not the tra nsfer \nof control of the physical asset.  \nAcceptability of usufruct / right -of-use asset from Shari\u2019ah perspective  \nBC16  In Ijarah , a lessee acquires  the usufruct of  an underlying asset during the Ijarah term and assumes an \nobligation to make payments to the less or for granting the right to use that asset. Additionally, the \nlessee has an obligation to return the underlying asset to the lessor at the end of the Ijarah term. The \n34 \n lessor has a right to receive payments from the lessee for providing the right to use th e underlying \nasset. The lessor also retains rights associated with ownership of the underlying asset. Having \nidentified the rights and obligations that arise from an Ijarah, the Board further considered which of \nthose rights and obligations create assets a nd liabilities to be accounted for in the books of lessee and \nlessor.  \nBC17  The preliminary study phase  for the standard  consisted with evaluating all concepts and theories by \nmany accounting bodies. An important topic under discussion was the acceptability and  recognition of \nusufruct as an asset. Shari\u2019ah considers right -of-use / usufruct as Maal i.e. transferable , with certain \nconditions,  and has its own characteristics of Maal. It was important to note that the Shari\u2019ah views \nusufruct as an intangible asset (being actually a right and not a physical asset).  \nBC18  The Board considered the pros and cons of this accounting approach, including Shari'ah issues \napplicable thereto after due consideration with the Shari\u2019ah board\u2019s committee for review of financial \naccounti ng and governance standards and decided that usufruct meets the definition of an asset \nunder Shari'ah and under AAOIFI Framework.  \nRecognition of right -of-use asset, its amortization  and residual value  \nBC19  The Board was of the view that from Shari'ah perspective, primarily there is an acquisition of a \nusufruct by the lessee and for that reason a liability is incurred . Accordingly, the initial recognition of \nthe usufruct is determined as the starting point. Therefore, the standard requires  the \u201cprime cost\u201d of \nthe right -of-use asset to be recognized , rather than recording the present value of minimum lease \npayments .  \nBC20  The Board, considering the Shari\u2019ah requirements and the specific characteristics of Ijarah \ntransactions, concluded that right -of-use is a  kind of  intangible asset and amortized accordingly. \nAmortization will be from commencement date (and not the inception date  \u2013 see also paragraph \nBC30) to the end of useful economic life of the right -of-use asset which will coincide with the en d of \nthe Ijarah term. Amortization over and above the Ijarah term, if allowed , means that the two \ntransactions are combined for the purpose of accounting.  \nBC21  Accordingly, the Board rejected the idea , even though certain experts during the public hearing s \nsuggested  to allow amortization of the right -of-use asset over a period over and above the Ijarah \nterm.  \nBC22  However, the Board considered that keeping a residual value  of the right -of-use asset  at the end of \nthe Ijarah term is an accounting estimate and may be kept  if there are additional economic benefits \nexpected. Accordingly, once the Ijarah term is complete, there will be a residual value that shall be \namortized on a straight -line basis or any other systematic basis, once it is transferred to the owned \nassets.  \nBC23  The Board considered that through this option the benefit can be passed on to the future periods \nwhereby the residual value is to be kept at a value close to the value of the asset at that time. This is \nalso in line with requirement in the S hari\u2019ah standards, whereby in the case of an early termination of \nan Ijarah the lessor is required to compensate the lessee with the additional rentals paid (in an Ijarah \nMBT) as compared to market norms .  \n35 \n Subsequent measurement \u2013 use of fair valuation for  right -of-use asset  \nBC24  The subsequent measurement of the right -of-use asset was discussed at the working group and the \nissue was also raised at the public hearings, where by the generally accepted accounting principles \nnormally allow for fair valuation of the  right -of-use asset. The Board initially considered  the proposal, \nbut considering the specific nature of an Ijarah right -of-use asset , took a considered view that  it might \nnot be the right approach to allow fair valuation  for an asset which has a limited life and which does \nnot reflect the underlying asset, but only the right -of-use of the same . This was also reaffirmed after \ndiscussions on the public hearing comments and the working group comments of the same.  \nBC25  The Board considered that if the right -of-use asset is revalued and the value has increased, there is a \nrisk that the periodic financial reports and the income statement will be distorted due to  the high \namounts of amortization, as this standard does not allow the a mortization of right -of-use asset \nbeyond the period of the Ijarah term i.e.  during the Ijarah term, there will be a higher charge of \namortization which may result in distortion of financial reporting for the period. The release of \nadditional effect of amo rtization will be done directly through equity so it will not be reflected in the \nincome statement. Considering these factors, the Board decided to not allow the fair valuation of \nright -of-use asset.  \nBC26  The Board evaluated the costs and expenses related to th e right -of-use asset.  There were two issues \nhighlighted in related to expenses of the underlying asset \u2013 an accounting  issue and Shari\u2019ah issue. \nThe current market practices  are generally to record the expense directly by the lessee . However, t he \nBoard was  of the considered view that these expenses shall be recorded by the lessor, and even if the \nlessee incurs the same, these shall be recorded as recoverable from lessor (even if lessor has a \nsupplementary rental mechanism to recover the same, which shall be  accounted for accordingly  as a \nrevenue ). \nIjarah MBT through gradual transfer / Diminishing Musharaka Ijarah  \nBC27  The Board after taking into account industry comments agreed that the accounting for Ijarah MBT \nthrough gradual transfer under FAS 8 was having pr actical impediments and required improvement . In \norder to avoid the complexities of accounting for Ijarah MBT with gradual transfer, the standard \nintroduces the underlying asset to be termed as a \u2018combined asset\u2019  which includes the proportionate \nunderlying asset as well as the right -of-use asset owned by the lessee .  \nBC28  It is also considered that if the units are sold at cost (to lessee) depreciation at the end by the lessor is \nnot required , as the residual value is equal to the cost.  This shall sign ificantly reduce the accounting \ncomplications.  \nBC29  The Board also considered that there are transactions in different parts of the world which are very \nsimilar in characteristics to Ijarah MBT with gradual transfer of ownership , such as \u2018Diminishing \nMusharaka  based on Shirkat -ul-Milk with Ijarah \u2019. The Board decided that all such products shall be \nsubject to the same accounting and reporting requirements under this standard.  \nIjarah commencement date vs. inception date  \u2013 issue of future Ijarah  \nBC30  The Board discuss ed at length the issue of the commencement date vs . inception date accounting . The \nBoard, in particular, noted that as per Shari\u2019ah, Ijarah rental can only be charged after possession of \nasset  (in usable condition)  to the lessee and rental is neither earne d nor recorded before possession \n36 \n and delivery of asset  (irrespective of the pricing mechanism involved, which may take into \nconsideration such period) , and this is one of the distinguishing factor between Ijarah MBT and \nconventional finance leases . The sim ilar issue in related to future Ijarah i.e. Ijarah Mawsufah fi al -\nDhimma  was also raised  and discussed during the public hearings and was duly considered by the \nBoard. However, after due deliberations, it was decided that any Ijarah rentals charged and / or \nreceived before the commencement date shall be recorded as an advance which shall rema in non-\nremunerative.  \nAccounting and financial reporting by the Lessor  \nBC31  Without any principal change from FAS 8 , this standard requires that the leased asset shall be \nrecognized at cost and depreciated over the useful life by the lessor and gross rentals shall be \nrecognized as income.  \nBC32  Generally, it was understood that depreciation shall be based mostly on straight -line method. \nHowever, there were situations where certain institutions  were using annuity method for \ndepreciation . The Board considered if there ne eds to be change to the depreciation method to allow \nannuity method  as this was further raised during the public hearing s of the standard. After due \ndeliberations the Board concluded that the annuity method of accounting was not suitable as it does \nnot ref lect the pattern of economic benefit s, as well as, is against the essence of Shari'ah.  \nBC33  The Board concluded  to keep the straight -line method, as a preferred method of revenue recognition \nand allowing another systematic basis i.e. using the effective rate o f return method.  This was based on \nthe fact that in certain situations the use of effective rate of return method for recognition of revenue \nmight result in more equitable and fair distribution of profits amongst stakeholders.  \nDeposits and Hamish Jiddiyah   \nBC34  The Board considered that t here are multiple types of deposits  or advance payments  in Ijarah  \ntransactions  \u2013 most commonly in the form of Hamish Jiddiyah or security deposit. As per Shari\u2019ah \nthese are a receivable of the lessee and payable of the lessor  and shall continue to be accounted for \nuntil the conclusion of the Ijarah term. After conclusion of the Ijarah term the same can be used as a \nsale transaction proceed or be refunded, as per the mutual arrangement between the parties . \nLease term and extension options  \nBC35  The Board considered and resolved that the Ijarah term shall include extension and termination \noptions as this is relevant due to the fact that the total term must be estimated and taken into \naccount for depreciation and amortization calculations. The assessment of probability of exercising \nthe extension is also in line with global best practices . There is a rebuttable presumption that \nexpressed intention of the lessee to exercise the extension option(s) provides reasonable certainty \nwith regard to extension of Ijarah term in line with genera lly accepted accounting p rinciples. \nSubsequent reassessment is also in line with generally accepted accounting principles.  \n37 \n Appendix C: Brief history of the preparation of the standard  \nH1 The newly formed AAOIFI Accounting Board (AAB) held its meeting No. 1 on 6 -7 of Jumada II 14 37H, \ncorresponding to 15 -16 of March 2016 at Ramee Grand Hotel, Kingdom of Bahrain.
